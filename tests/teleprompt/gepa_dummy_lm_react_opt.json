Use toolA to map employee -> department.\n          - toolB: accepts a department name string (examples: \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\") and returns the department's budget as a numeric value (integer or numeric string). Use toolB to get department budgets.\n          - toolC: accepts an employee first name string (examples: \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\") and returns that employee's salary as a numeric value (integer or numeric string). Use toolC to get salaries.\n        - next_tool_args requirement: always pass a JSON object with a single key \"arg\" whose value is a plain string. Example: {\"arg\": \"Alice\"} or {\"arg\": \"Red\"}. Do NOT pass nested objects like {\"arg\": {\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"Alice\"}} and do NOT pass long or multi-item queries as the single arg.\n        - Typical correct patterns:\n          - To get an employee's department budget:\n            1) toolA with {\"arg\": \"<FirstName>\"} -> returns department (e.g., \"Red\")\n            2) toolB with {\"arg\": \"<Department>\"} -> returns numeric budget\n          - To get an employee's salary: toolC with {\"arg\": \"<FirstName>\"} -> returns numeric salary\n        - When you obtain numeric values, compute required arithmetic locally (do not attempt to ask tools to compute it). After computing the numeric answer, call finish (with {}) to indicate you are done and then the extractor will produce the final `answer`.\n        - If a tool returns a non-numeric string but you expected a numeric value, re-check that you called the correct tool with a correct single-string arg. If you already called the correct tool and still get non-numeric output, you may retry the proper call; but do not send free-form queries to the tools.\n        - Each reasoning step (next_thought) should be concise: state what you will fetch next and why. Keep tool args minimal and valid.\n        - Always prefer the minimal, correct sequence of tool calls to collect numbers before computing.\n        \n        Output format per step (repeat until finish):\n        - next_thought: short reasoning/plan for the next action\n        - next_tool_name: one of toolA, toolB, toolC, or finish\n        - next_tool_args: JSON object, e.g. {\"arg\": \"Alice\"}; for finish use {}\n        \n        When you call finish, you are indicating the trajectory contains all information needed to compute the final `answer`."

Given the input field `question`, produce a sequence of interleaved fields (next_thought, next_tool_name, next_tool_args) for each step, calling tools as needed, and finish by calling the special tool `finish` when all information needed to compute the final `answer` is available.\n\nImportant rules and conventions\n- Tools and their intended, strict usage:\n  - toolA: accepts an employee first name string (examples: \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\") and returns that employee's department name as a short string (one of \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\"). Use toolA to map employee -> department.\n  - toolB: accepts a department name string (examples: \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\") and returns the department's budget as a numeric value (integer or numeric string). Use toolB to get department budgets.\n  - toolC: accepts an employee first name string (examples: \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\") and returns that employee's salary as a numeric value (integer or numeric string). Use toolC to get salaries.\n- next_tool_args requirement: always pass a JSON object with a single key \"arg\" whose value is a plain string. Example: {\"arg\": \"Alice\"} or {\"arg\": \"Red\"}. Do NOT pass nested objects like {\"arg\": {\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"Alice\"}} and do NOT pass long or multi-item queries as the single arg.\n- Typical correct patterns:\n  - To get an employee's department budget:\n    1) toolA with {\"arg\": \"<FirstName>\"} -> returns department (e.g., \"Red\")\n    2) toolB with {\"arg\": \"<Department>\"} -> returns numeric budget\n  - To get an employee's salary: toolC with {\"arg\": \"<FirstName>\"} -> returns numeric salary\n- When you obtain numeric values, compute required arithmetic locally (do not attempt to ask tools to compute it). After computing the numeric answer, call finish (with {}) to indicate you are done and then the extractor will produce the final `answer`.\n- If a tool returns a non-numeric string but you expected a numeric value, re-check that you called the correct tool with a correct single-string arg. If you already called the correct tool and still get non-numeric output, you may retry the proper call; but do not send free-form queries to the tools.\n- Each reasoning step (next_thought) should be concise: state what you will fetch next and why. Keep tool args minimal and valid.\n- Always prefer the minimal, correct sequence of tool calls to collect numbers before computing.\n\nOutput format per step (repeat until finish):\n- next_thought: short reasoning/plan for the next action\n- next_tool_name: one of toolA, toolB, toolC, or finish\n- next_tool_args: JSON object, e.g. {\"arg\": \"Alice\"}; for finish use {}\n\nWhen you call finish, you are indicating the trajectory contains all information needed to compute the final `answer`.\n\n[[ ## improved_extract_instruction ## ]]\nWhen the ReAct trajectory ends (after the agent calls finish), produce the final output field `answer` (a single value). Use the trajectory observations to compute the numeric answer required by `question`. Rules:\n- Parse observations in the trajectory in order. Expected observation types:\n  - Responses from toolA: department name (string: e.g., \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\")\n  - Responses from toolB: numeric department budget (integer or numeric string)\n  - Responses from toolC: numeric salary (integer or numeric string)\n- Use the mapping steps the agent followed (e.g., person -> dept via toolA, dept -> budget via toolB, or person -> salary via toolC) to identify the numeric values needed.\n- Convert numeric strings to numbers and perform the arithmetic required by the question (subtraction, etc.). If multiple numeric values are present, use the ones relevant to the question.\n- The final `answer` field should be a concise result matching the expected format in examples (just the numeric result as a string or number, e.g., \"7\" or 19). You may include a brief single-line explanation in reasoning if your system expects it, but the `answer` field must contain the numeric result.\n- If the required numeric values cannot be found in the trajectory (because the agent never obtained numeric outputs), the extractor should indicate this by returning a clear short message in `answer` like: \"Missing numeric values\" (but agents should avoid this by following the React instruction).\n\n[[ ## improved_tool_toola_desc ## ]]\nTool A — Use exactly: {\"arg\": \"<FirstName>\"} where <FirstName> is an employee first name (e.g., \"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\").
