Output only the minute number\u2014no text or other fields.\n        \n        What to analyze\n        - Clock face orientation: Identify where \u201c12\u201d is on the dial. Use the numerals (Arabic or Roman, stylized fonts) or the positions of 3, 6, 9, 12 to set the reference. If the photo is tilted, measure angles relative to the clock face, not the image frame.\n        - Hands identification (do not confuse them):\n          - Minute hand: typically the longest solid hand reaching near the minute ticks/outer ring; thicker than the second hand; often has a pronounced pointer tip.\n          - Hour hand: shorter and thicker, typically ends near the numerals.\n          - Second hand (if present): the thinnest, often the longest, usually with a counterweight; ignore it for minute reading.\n          - If two non-second hands look similar, the one whose tip reaches closer to the minute tick ring is the minute hand.\n        - Ticks and numerals: Each numeral-to-numeral segment equals 5 minutes. If minute tick marks exist, use them. If not, divide each numeral interval evenly into five.\n        \n        How to compute the minute\n        1. Locate the clock center and the minute hand\u2019s tip.\n        2. Determine the angle of the minute hand from the 12 o\u2019clock direction, increasing clockwise.\n        3. Convert angle to minutes: minute_estimate = (angle_from_12 / 6). Round to the nearest whole minute.\n           - Mapping: 12 \u2192 0, 1 \u2192 5, 2 \u2192 10, 3 \u2192 15, 4 \u2192 20, 5 \u2192 25, 6 \u2192 30, 7 \u2192 35, 8 \u2192 40, 9 \u2192 45, 10 \u2192 50, 11 \u2192 55.\n           - If the tip is slightly past a numeral (e.g., just past 3), do not snap to the numeral; round to the nearest minute (e.g., 16 instead of 15).\n        4. Consistency check with the hour hand (useful to avoid off-by-one and hand mix-ups):\n           - The hour hand moves continuously: it advances 0.5 degrees per minute (i.e., 1/12 of the way to the next numeral every 5 minutes).\n           - If your minute_estimate is an exact multiple of 5 but the hour hand is clearly between hour markers (not aligned with an hour), re-examine: the minute hand is likely slightly past the numeral; adjust to the nearest minute accordingly.\n           - If the minute hand choice is ambiguous, infer the minute from the hour hand\u2019s fraction toward the next hour: minute \u2248 fraction_between_hour_markers \u00d7 60, then choose the hand assignment that matches this.\n        5. Edge cases:\n           - Overlapping hands: Look at which tip extends farther toward the tick ring to identify the minute hand.\n           - Strong perspective or glare: Use the line from center to the visible tip; ignore reflections.\n           - No minute ticks: Evenly interpolate between numerals.\n           - Subdials or decorative elements (e.g., pendulum windows) are not the minute indicator; use the main dial only.\n        \n        Output format\n        - Return only the integer minute value (0\u201359) in the minute field.\n        - If the angle computes to 60, output 0.\n        \n        Error prevention reminders\n        - Do not treat the hour hand as the minute hand.\n        - Do not use the second hand to compute minutes.\n        - Do not assume the minute hand is exactly on a numeral\u2014check for slight offsets and round to the nearest minute.\n        - Ensure the final minute agrees with the hour hand\u2019s position trend (hour hand slightly past an hour implies minutes > 0)."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[[ ## clock_photo ## ]]\n"}, {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Pendulum_clock_by_Jacob_Kock%2C_antique_furniture_photography%2C_IMG_0931_edit.jpg/500px-Pendulum_clock_by_Jacob_Kock%2C_antique_furniture_photography%2C_IMG_0931_edit.jpg"}}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## minute ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python int), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`."}]}], "kwargs": {}, "response": "ModelResponse(id='chatcmpl-CE7ARdyH04qBQhvBityisBdtWvQ3G', created=1757480179, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, choices=[Choices(finish_reason='stop', index=0, message=Message(content='[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\n- The \u201c12\u201d is at the top; the face is upright.\\n- The longer hand reaches the outer minute ring and points to the 9 position.\\n- The shorter hour hand is near the 4, consistent with about 3:45.\\n- 9 on the dial corresponds to 45 minutes.\\n\\n[[ ## minute ## ]]\\n45\\n\\n[[ ## completed ## ]]', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'refusal': None}, annotations=[]), provider_specific_fields={})], usage={}, service_tier='default', cache_hit=True)", "outputs": ["[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\n- The \u201c12\u201d is at the top; the face is upright.\n- The longer hand reaches the outer minute ring and points to the 9 position.\n- The shorter hour hand is near the 4, consistent with about 3:45.\n- 9 on the dial corresponds to 45 minutes.\n\n[[ ## minute ## ]]\n45\n\n[[ ## completed ## ]]"], "usage": {}, "cost": 0.0326675, "timestamp": "2025-09-09T22:45:47.058716", "uuid": "69e71807-0b0a-40e6-8576-908dcac161a2", "model": "openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07", "response_model": "gpt-5-2025-08-07", "model_type": "chat"}, {"prompt": null, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Your input fields are:\n1. `clock_photo` (Image):\nYour output fields are:\n1. `reasoning` (str): \n2. `hour` (int):\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## clock_photo ## ]]\n{clock_photo}\n\n[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\n{reasoning}\n\n[[ ## hour ## ]]\n{hour}        # note: the value you produce must be a single int value\n\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\nIn adhering to this structure, your objective is: \n        Task\n        - Input: clock_photo (an image of an analog clock)\n        - Output: hour (an integer 1\u201312).

Map 0 to 12 (i.e., if floor(...) = 0, H = 12).\n        - Do not round up to the next hour. The correct hour is the number the hour hand has most recently passed, not the one it is approaching.\n        - If the hour hand appears exactly on an hour mark but the minute hand is not at 12, treat it as still between hours and choose the lower (last passed) hour.\n        \n        7) Edge cases and robustness\n        - Stylized or missing numerals: rely on the 12/3/6/9 axes and tick marks rather than numeral shapes.\n        - Roman numerals: \u201c4\u201d may be IIII; positions are unchanged.\n        - Ignore mirrored effects, reflections, and shadows; only consider hands anchored at the pivot.\n        - Overlap times: if hands nearly overlap, use \u03b8m to ensure the hour hand offset matches 0.5\u00b0 per minute.\n        - Return 12, not 0, when appropriate (e.g., just after 12:00).\n        \n        Output format\n        - Provide only: hour as an integer in [1,12], with no additional text.\n        \n        Common error prevention (from prior mistakes)\n        - Do not confuse the minute hand for the hour hand; verify by length and reach to the outer tick marks.\n        - Do not infer times like \u201c10:10\u201d by default; always read from the actual hand angles.\n        - Ensure the hour chosen matches the \u201clast passed\u201d number given the minute hand\u2019s position (e.g., at ~:16, the hour hand must be just past the hour, not near 1 when the minute hand is at 3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "[[ ## clock_photo ## ]]\n"}, {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Telechron_clock_2H07-Br_Administrator.JPG/960px-Telechron_clock_2H07-Br_Administrator.JPG"}}, {"type": "text", "text": "\n\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## hour ## ]]` (must be formatted as a valid Python int), and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`."}]}], "kwargs": {}, "response": "ModelResponse(id='chatcmpl-CE795hHSfyueLWRnKzAItXatIVYsk', created=1757480095, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, choices=[Choices(finish_reason='stop', index=0, message=Message(content='[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\\n- 12 is at the top; numerals upright.\\n- The longest hand points to 3 (15 minutes).\\n- The shortest/thick hand is just past 2, about a quarter of the way toward 3, consistent with 15 minutes past.\\n- Therefore the last passed hour is 2.\\n\\n[[ ## hour ## ]]\\n2\\n\\n[[ ## completed ## ]]', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'refusal': None}, annotations=[]), provider_specific_fields={})], usage={}, service_tier='default', cache_hit=True)", "outputs": ["[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\n- 12 is at the top; numerals upright.\n- The longest hand points to 3 (15 minutes).\n- The shortest/thick hand is just past 2, about a quarter of the way toward 3, consistent with 15 minutes past.\n- Therefore the last passed hour is 2.\n\n[[ ## hour ## ]]\n2\n\n[[ ## completed ## ]]"], "usage": {}, "cost": 0.009407500000000001, "timestamp": "2025-09-09T22:45:47.059973", "uuid": "2a0e4b56-b85e-44ea-b3f5-d71c2d7e42cb", "model": "openai/gpt-5-2025-08-07", "response_model": "gpt-5-2025-08-07", "model_type": "chat"}, {"prompt": null, "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Your input fields are:\n1. `clock_photo` (Image):\nYour output fields are:\n1. `reasoning` (str): \n2. `minute` (int):\nAll interactions will be structured in the following way, with the appropriate values filled in.\n\n[[ ## clock_photo ## ]]\n{clock_photo}\n\n[[ ## reasoning ## ]]\n{reasoning}\n\n[[ ## minute ## ]]\n{minute}        # note: the value you produce must be a single int value\n\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\nIn adhering to this structure, your objective is: \n        Task: From the image field clock_photo (an analog clock), output the minute value as an integer from 0\u201359 in the field minute.

Output only the minute number\u2014no text or other fields.\\n\\nWhat to analyze\\n- Clock face orientation: Identify where \u201c12\u201d is on the dial. Use the numerals (Arabic or Roman, stylized fonts) or the positions of 3, 6, 9, 12 to set the reference. If the photo is tilted, measure angles relative to the clock face, not the image frame.\\n- Hands identification (do not confuse them):\\n  - Minute hand: typically the longest solid hand reaching near the minute ticks/outer ring; thicker than the second hand; often has a pronounced pointer tip.\\n  - Hour hand: shorter and thicker, typically ends near the numerals.\\n  - Second hand (if present): the thinnest, often the longest, usually with a counterweight; ignore it for minute reading.\\n  - If two non-second hands look similar, the one whose tip reaches closer to the minute tick ring is the minute hand.\\n- Ticks and numerals: Each numeral-to-numeral segment equals 5 minutes.

Output only the minute number\u2014no text or other fields.\n\nWhat to analyze\n- Clock face orientation: Identify where \u201c12\u201d is on the dial. Use the numerals (Arabic or Roman, stylized fonts) or the positions of 3, 6, 9, 12 to set the reference. If the photo is tilted, measure angles relative to the clock face, not the image frame.\n- Hands identification (do not confuse them):\n  - Minute hand: typically the longest solid hand reaching near the minute ticks/outer ring; thicker than the second hand; often has a pronounced pointer tip.\n  - Hour hand: shorter and thicker, typically ends near the numerals.\n  - Second hand (if present): the thinnest, often the longest, usually with a counterweight; ignore it for minute reading.\n  - If two non-second hands look similar, the one whose tip reaches closer to the minute tick ring is the minute hand.\n- Ticks and numerals: Each numeral-to-numeral segment equals 5 minutes. If minute tick marks exist, use them. If not, divide each numeral interval evenly into five.\n\nHow to compute the minute\n1. Locate the clock center and the minute hand\u2019s tip.\n2.
