# dspy.MultiChainComparison

### Constructor

The constructor initializes the `MultiChainComparison` class and sets up its attributes. It inherits from the `Predict` class and adds specific functionality for multiple chain comparisons.

The class incorporates multiple student attempt reasonings and concludes with the selected best reasoning path out of the available attempts.

```python
from .predict import Predict
from ..primitives.program import Module

import dsp

class MultiChainComparison(Module):
    def __init__(self, signature, M=3, temperature=0.7, **config):
        super().__init__()

        self.M = M
        signature = Predict(signature).signature
        *keys, last_key = signature.kwargs.keys()

        extended_kwargs = {key: signature.kwargs[key] for key in keys}

        for idx in range(M):
            candidate_type = dsp.Type(prefix=f"Student Attempt #{idx+1}:", desc="${reasoning attempt}")
            extended_kwargs.update({f'reasoning_attempt_{idx+1}': candidate_type})
        
        rationale_type = dsp.Type(prefix="Accurate Reasoning: Thank you everyone. Let's now holistically", desc="${corrected reasoning}")
        extended_kwargs.update({'rationale': rationale_type, last_key: signature.kwargs[last_key]})

        signature = dsp.Template(signature.instructions, **extended_kwargs)
        self.predict = Predict(signature, temperature=temperature, **config)
        self.last_key = last_key
```

**Parameters:**
- `signature` (_Any_): Signature of predictive model.
- `M` (_int_, _optional_): Number of student reasoning attempts. Defaults to `3`.
- `temperature` (_float_, _optional_): Temperature parameter for prediction. Defaults to `0.7`.
- `**config` (_dict_): Additional configuration parameters for model.

### Method

#### `forward(self, completions, **kwargs)`

This method aggregates all the student reasoning attempts and calls the predict method with extended signatures to get the best reasoning.

**Parameters:**
- `completions`: List of completion objects which include student reasoning attempts.
- `**kwargs`: Additional keyword arguments.

**Returns:**
- The result of the `predict` method for the best reasoning.

### Examples

```python
class BasicQA(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions with short factoid answers."""
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="often between 1 and 5 words")

# Example completions generated by a model for reference
completions = [
    dspy.Prediction(rationale="I recall that during clear days, the sky often appears this color.", answer="blue"),
    dspy.Prediction(rationale="Based on common knowledge, I believe the sky is typically seen as this color.", answer="green"),
    dspy.Prediction(rationale="From images and depictions in media, the sky is frequently represented with this hue.", answer="blue"),
]

# Pass signature to MultiChainComparison module
compare_answers = dspy.MultiChainComparison(BasicQA)

# Call the MultiChainComparison on the completions
question = 'What is the color of the sky?'
final_pred = compare_answers(completions, question=question)

print(f"Question: {question}")
print(f"Final Predicted Answer (after comparison): {final_pred.answer}")
print(f"Final Rationale: {final_pred.rationale}")
```
