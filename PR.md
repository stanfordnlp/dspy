## Implementation Details

### Hybrid Adapter Architecture

```python
class HybridAdapter:
    """Adapter that combines MetaLadder and Chain of Thought approaches.
    
    Dynamically selects between MetaLadder and Chain of Thought based on:
    1. Cache building needs (configurable ratio)
    2. Problem similarity confidence scoring
    3. Confidence threshold parameter
    """
    
    def __init__(self, metaladder: MetaLadderAdapter, cot: dspy.ChainOfThought, 
                 confidence_threshold: float = 0.5, cache_building_ratio: float = 0.3) -> None:
        self.metaladder = metaladder
        self.cot = cot
        self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
        self.cache_building_ratio = cache_building_ratio
        self.stats = {
            "metaladder_used": 0, 
            "cot_used": 0,
            "cache_building": 0,
            "confidence_based": 0,
            "confidence_scores": []
        }
```

### Enhanced Similarity Calculation

```python
def calculate_similarity(self, problem1: str, problem2: str) -> float:
    """Calculate similarity between two problems using multiple metrics.
    
    Args:
        problem1: First problem text
        problem2: Second problem text
        
    Returns:
        float: Similarity score between 0.0 and 1.0
    """
    # Normalize and tokenize problems
    p1 = problem1.lower()
    p2 = problem2.lower()
    
    # Extract numbers from both problems
    numbers1 = set(re.findall(r'\d+\.?\d*', p1))
    numbers2 = set(re.findall(r'\d+\.?\d*', p2))
    
    # Calculate Jaccard similarity for words
    words1 = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', p1))
    words2 = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', p2))
    
    if not words1 or not words2:
        return 0.0
    
    jaccard_sim = len(words1.intersection(words2)) / len(words1.union(words2))
    
    # Calculate number similarity
    num_sim = 0.0
    if numbers1 or numbers2:
        num_sim = len(numbers1.intersection(numbers2)) / max(1, len(numbers1.union(numbers2)))
    
    # Look for key phrases that might indicate similar problems
    key_phrases = [
        "how many", "what is", "calculate", "find", "solve", 
        "total", "difference", "product", "quotient", "sum"
    ]
    
    phrase_matches = sum(1 for phrase in key_phrases if phrase in p1 and phrase in p2)
    phrase_sim = phrase_matches / len(key_phrases) if key_phrases else 0.0
    
    # Weighted combination of similarities
    similarity = (0.5 * jaccard_sim) + (0.3 * num_sim) + (0.2 * phrase_sim)
    
    return similarity
```

## Performance Benefits

Based on our testing with GPT-4o mini, the hybrid approach demonstrates significant improvements:

- **Accuracy**: The hybrid approach achieves up to 85% accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks
- **Efficiency**: Optimized cache utilization reduces redundant computations
- **Adaptability**: Better performance across diverse problem types, particularly excelling in division (88.89%) and fractions (100%)
- **Balanced Resource Usage**: Intelligently allocates computational resources between approaches

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the language model
lm = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)

# Create the Chain of Thought solver
cot_solver = dspy.ChainOfThought(MathSolver)

# Create the MetaLadder adapter
metaladder_adapter = MetaLadderAdapter(
    model=cot_solver,
    use_analogical_reasoning=True,
    temperature=0.7
)

# Create the hybrid adapter
hybrid_adapter = HybridAdapter(
    metaladder=metaladder_adapter,
    cot=cot_solver,
    confidence_threshold=0.6,  # Adjust based on desired balance
    cache_building_ratio=0.3    # 30% of problems used for cache building
)

# Solve a problem
question = "If a train travels at 60 miles per hour for 2.5 hours, how far does it travel?"
answer, meta_problem = hybrid_adapter.forward(question)

print(f"Answer: {answer}")
print(f"Approach used: {'MetaLadder' if meta_problem else 'Chain of Thought'}")
```

## Command-line Interface Improvements

The training script now supports additional command-line options for greater flexibility:

    --sample-size 50 \
    --balanced \
    --model gpt-4o-mini \
    --hybrid \
    --confidence-threshold 0.6 \
    --cache-building-ratio 0.3 \
