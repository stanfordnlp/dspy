      "To determine the maximum value of live load force in bar CG, we need to consider the effects of both the uniform live load and the concentrated live load. The uniform live load of 0.32 kip/ft will cause a distributed force along the entire length of the truss, while the concentrated live load of 24 kips will be applied at a specific point. The maximum force in bar CG will occur when the concentrated load is applied at the point where it will produce the largest force. This point is typically at the midpoint of the truss span, which is 45 feet from each end. The maximum force in bar CG will be the sum of the forces due to the uniform live load and the concentrated live load. The uniform live load will cause a force of 0.32 kip/ft * 45 ft = 14.4 kips. The concentrated live load will cause a force of 24 kips. Therefore, the maximum force in bar CG will be 14.4 kips + 24 kips = 38.4 kips. Since the bar is a compression member, the maximum force will be in compression. The maximum value of live load force in bar CG is 38.4 kips, which is not listed among the choices.

      "To determine the number of photographs taken by camera A, we need to calculate the area covered by each photograph and then divide the total area of the strip by the area covered by each photograph. The area covered by each photograph is given by the format size of the camera, which is 180 mm x 180 mm. The total area of the strip is 16 km x 1350 m = 21,600,000 m^2. The area covered by each photograph is 180 mm x 180 mm = 32,400 mm^2 = 0.00324 m^2. Therefore, the number of photographs taken by camera A is 21,600,000 m^2 / 0.00324 m^2 = 6,666,666.67. Since we can't take a fraction of a photograph, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6,666,667. However, this is not one of the choices provided.

      "To calculate the volume of earthwork using the prismoidal rule, we first need to determine the rise in level (R.L.) for each 100 meters of distance. The table provided shows the R.L. for each 100 meters of distance. The rise in level for 400 meters can be calculated by summing the R.L. values for each 100 meters and then multiplying by the distance (400 meters). The volume of earthwork can then be calculated using the formula for the prismoidal rule: Volume = (B1 + B2 + 4 * (B3 + B4 + ... + Bn)) * (L/2), where B1, B2, B3, ..., Bn are the widths at each 100 meters of distance, and L is the length of the embankment. The width at each 100 meters of distance can be calculated using the side slope of 2:1 and the width at the formation level (12 m). The rise in level for 400 meters is calculated as follows: R.L. for 400 meters = R.L. for 0 meters + R.L. for 100 meters + R.L. for 200 meters + R.L. for 300 meters + R.L. for 400 meters = 107.00 + 106.2 + 107.5 + 107.2 + 108.3 = 526.2 meters. The rise in level for 400 meters is then divided by the length of the embankment (400 meters) to get the rise in level per meter: Rise in level per meter = 526.2 meters / 400 meters = 1.3155 meters. The width at each 100 meters of distance can be calculated using the side slope of 2:1 and the width at the formation level (12 m): Width at 100 meters = 12 m + (12 m * 2) = 36 m Width at 200 meters = 36 m + (36 m * 2) = 108 m Width at 300 meters = 108 m + (108 m * 2) = 324 m Width at 400 meters = 324 m + (324 m * 2) = 1056 m The volume of earthwork can then be calculated using the formula for the prismoidal rule: Volume = (B1 + B2 + 4 * (B3 + B4 + ... + Bn)) * (L/2) = (12 m + 36 m + 4 * (108 m + 324 m + 1056 m)) * (400 meters / 2) = (48 m + 4 * (108 m + 324 m + 1056 m)) * 200 meters = (48 m + 4 * 1488 m) * 200 meters = (48 m + 5952 m) * 200 meters = 6000 m * 200 meters = 1200000 m^3.

      "The voltage across the resistor $v_R(t)$ in a series RL circuit can be found using the formula $v_R(t) = v(t) - i(t)R$, where $v(t)$ is the voltage source, $i(t)$ is the current through the inductor, and $R$ is the resistance. The current through the inductor is given by $i(t) = L \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$, where $L$ is the inductance. For a unit ramp voltage source, $v(t) = t$, and the derivative of $v(t)$ is $1$. Therefore, $i(t) = L \\cdot 1 = L$. Substituting $v(t)$, $i(t)$, and $R$ into the formula for $v_R(t)$ gives $v_R(t) = t - L \\cdot 1 \\cdot R = t - L \\cdot R$. Given $L = 0.1$H and $R = 1$Ω, $v_R(t) = t - 0.1 \\cdot 1 = t - 0.1$. However, this is not one of the given options. The correct approach is to recognize that the voltage across the resistor is the difference between the voltage source and the voltage drop across the inductor, which is given by $L \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$. For a unit ramp voltage source, the derivative of $v(t)$ is $1$, so the voltage drop across the inductor is $L \\cdot 1 = 0.1 \\cdot 1 = 0.1$. Therefore, $v_R(t) = v(t) - 0.1 = t - 0.1$.

      "The height \\(h\\) can be found using the principle of hydrostatics, which states that the pressure at any point in a fluid is the same in all directions. The pressure at the bottom of the gasoline column is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the water column plus the pressure due to the height \\(h\\) of the gasoline column. The pressure due to the height \\(h\\) of the gasoline column can be calculated using the formula \\(P = \\rho g h\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the density of the gasoline, \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \\(h\\) is the height of the gasoline column. The density of gasoline is given as 1.60 times the density of water, and the density of water is \\(1000 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3\\). The acceleration due to gravity is approximately \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\). The height of the water column is 1.5 meters, and the height of the gasoline column is \\(h\\). Therefore, the pressure at the bottom of the gasoline column is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the water column plus the pressure due to the height \\(h\\) of the gasoline column. The pressure at the bottom of the water column is equal to the weight of the water column divided by the area of the water column. The weight of the water column is equal to the volume of the water column times the density of water times the acceleration due to gravity. The volume of the water column is equal to the area of the water column times the height of the water column. The area of the water column is equal to the area of the gasoline column times the ratio of the density of gasoline to the density of water. Therefore, the pressure at the bottom of the gasoline column is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the water column plus the pressure due to the height \\(h\\) of the gasoline column. The pressure at the bottom of the gasoline column is equal to the pressure at the bottom of the water column plus the pressure due to the height \\(h\\) of the gasoline column.

      "The average normal stress in a cable is given by the formula \\(\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\\), where \\(F\\) is the force and \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area. Since the force is the same for both cables, the average normal stress will be the same if the cross-sectional areas are the same. The diameter of the cable is given as 10 mm for AC, so we need to find the diameter of AB that will give the same cross-sectional area. The cross-sectional area of a circle is given by \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius. The radius of the 10 mm diameter cable is 5 mm. We need to find the radius of the AB cable that will have the same cross-sectional area. Let's denote the radius of the AB cable as \\(r_{AB}\\). We have \\(\\pi (5^2) = \\pi (r_{AB}^2)\\). Solving for \\(r_{AB}\\), we get \\(r_{AB} = 5\\). The diameter of the AB cable is twice the radius, so the diameter of AB is 10 mm. However, this is not one of the options. We need to find the diameter that will give the same cross-sectional area as the 10 mm diameter cable. The cross-sectional area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius. Therefore, the diameter of the AB cable that will give the same cross-sectional area as the 10 mm diameter cable is the square root of 10 mm, which is approximately 3.16 mm.

      "The maximum-normal-stress theory states that yielding will occur when the maximum normal stress exceeds the yield strength. The maximum normal stress is the larger of the two principal stresses. For point a, the maximum normal stress is 200 MPa (σ1), and for point b, it is 150 MPa (σ1). Since the yield strength of the steel is 400 MPa, the frame will experience initial yielding when the maximum normal stress reaches 400 MPa. To find the test load at which this occurs, we need to determine the load that will cause the maximum normal stress to reach 400 MPa. The load can be calculated using the formula: Load = (σ1 - Sy) / (Ssy - Sy), where σ1 is the maximum normal stress, Sy is the yield strength, and Ssy is the strain hardening modulus. For point a, the load is (200 - 400) / (250 - 400) = -200 MPa / -150 MPa = 1.33 kN. For point b, the load is (150 - 400) / (250 - 400) = -250 MPa / -150 MPa = 1.67 kN. Since the load for point b is greater than the load for point a, the frame will experience initial yielding at a test load of 1.67 kN. However, since the load must be in kN, we need to convert the load from MPa to kN. The conversion factor is 1 MPa = 0.001 kN. Therefore, the test load at which the frame will experience initial yielding is 1.67 MPa * 0.001 kN/MPa = 1.67 kN. To find the answer, we need to round the load to the nearest whole number, which is 2 kN. However, since the options are given in kN, we need to convert the load back to kN.
