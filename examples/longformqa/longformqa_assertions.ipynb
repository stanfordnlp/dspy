    "This notebook builds upon the foundational concepts of the **DSPy** framework, as introduced in our previous tutorial (see [intro.ipynb](./intro.ipynb) for a refresher). DSPy overs a novel programming-centric approach to utilizing language and retrieval models. It offers a unique blend of prompting, reasoning, fine-tuning, and tool augmentation, all encapsulated under a minimalistic Python syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this advancement of DSPy, we introduce **Assertions**, a feature with the capability to declare computational constraints within DSPy programs. This allows programmers to specify natural-language rules for valid outputs, guiding the behavior of language model calls during both compiling and inference stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach harnesses Pythonic style of assertions while meshing backtracking logic to ensure autonomous self-correction and refinement of language model calls. By accounting for past outputs and passing forward relevant feedback and guidelines for self-correction, this feature offers a significant leap in DSPy with enhanced control over program behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the utility of assertions on specific downstream examples, extending the Multi-Hop Question-Answering task from the [intro.ipynb](./intro.ipynb) to long-form paragraph generation with citations to answer questions. We demonstrate the performance benefits of integrating assertions to ensure the inclusion of citations in a predefined format and the faithfulness of generated text to its cited references. "
