    "**If you're curious how it works:** This optimizer works by running your program (in this case, `zeroshot_chain`) on `trainset` questions. Each time it runs, DSPy will remember the input and output of each LM call. These are called traces, and this particular optimizer will keep track of \"good\" traces (i.e., ones that the metric likes). Then, this optimizer will try to find good ways to leverage these traces as automatic few-shot examples. It will try them out, seeking to maximize the average metric on `valset`. There are many ways to self-generate (bootstrap) examples. There are also many ways to optimize their selection (here, with random search). That's why there are several other optimizers in DSPy."
