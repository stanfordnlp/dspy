In DSPy 2.5, the default Adapters are now more natively aware of chat LMs and are responsible for enforcing types, building on earlier experimental features from `TypedPredictor` and `configure(experimental=True)`. In our experience, this change tends to deliver more consistent pre-optimization quality from various LMs, especially for sophisticated Signatures."
