    "### FAQ 🙋\n",
    "#### 1) How does MIPRO work?\n",
    "At a high level, the MIPRO program optimizer works by first __proposing__ candidate fewshot example sets and instructions for each prompt in your program, and then __optimizing__ over these fewshot example sets and instructions as hyperparameters for a specified number of batches. Each batch, the optimizer evaluates different combinations of prompts on a subset of training inputs, which allows it to learn which combinations yield the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) How much will MIPRO cost me to run?\n",
    "Note that __this notebook__ is free to run, because all LM calls have been cached. However, when using an optimizer on your own program, here is a breakdown of the upper bound of the number of calls to the task model and prompt model respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task model calls**: MIPRO makes up to __O(TxPxM)__ task model calls if you run without minibatching, where T is the number of batches, P is the number of prompts in the program, and M is the size of the train set. This is because the model is evaluating the program on the train set each batch.  If you run **with minibatching** you can reduce calls even further to __O(TxPxB)__ where **B** is the minibatch size.  Note that every few steps (a parameter you set) MIPRO will also run a full eval over all **M** examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt model calls**: MIPRO makes up to N*P+10+(P+1) prompt model calls, where N is the number of instruction / fewshot example set candidates to generate for each prompt, and P is the number of prompts in the program. The extra 10 calls comes from generating a summary of the data in the training set, which we use in the meta prompt to create better instructions.  The extra (P+1) comes from program summarization where the proposer LLM will look at the program code and try to describe what each module does and what the whole program does.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) How should I configure the hyperparameters?\n",
    "We have yet to run full hyperparameter sweeps with MIPRO, but based off of initial experimintation, we'd recommend the following:\n",
    "- __Batch num__: Gains can be seen after about 20-30 batches. However, 100-200 batches can help with adding on additional marginal gains.\n",
    "- __num candidates__: This hyperparameter controls the number of candidate prompts and fewshot example sets that are generated to optimize over. With more batches and less prompts to optimize, we can set n to be higher, as we have more batches to explore different combinations of prompts. If your program has between 2-3 modules and is the `num_batches=30`, we'd recommend ~`n=10`. If n is higher (say `n=100`), then we can go higher to ~`n=15`. If you have a program with only 1 module and are keeping the program 0-shot (ie. no fewshot examples), then `num_batches` should be set to equal `n`, because each batch can explore a new instruction.\n",
    "- __Training set size__: Between 100 and 500 training examples are recommended, however MIPROv2 can still work well with fewer. Increasing the training set size can help prevent overfitting, and only slightly increases cost for the full evaluation runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) What should I do if I want to reduce the cost?\n",
    "You can always update hyperparameters accordingly, such as using a smaller train set, using less batches, or using a program with less modules.  You should take advantage of minibatching.\n",
    "Alternatively, one strategy would be to optimize using a cheaper task model (ie. locally hosted Llama-3), as initial experiments have shown that prompts optimized for a smaller model also transfer to working well on a larger model."

      "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the ranking. We are trying to answer the question about Mikael Blomkvist's profession in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\". We can start by looking at the passages that mention Mikael Blomkvist, which are passages [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [7], and [8]. Passage [1] and [5] are identical and do not provide any new information. Passage [2] mentions that Michael Nyqvist played the role of Mikael Blomkvist in the \"Millennium\" series, which is relevant to our question. Passage [3] mentions that Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist who investigates a disappearance, which is also relevant to our question. Passage [6] is identical to passage [2] and does not provide any new information. Passage [7] mentions that Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist in \"The Girl in the Spider's Web\", which is the most relevant passage to our question. Passage [8] is identical to passage [3] and does not provide any new information. Passage [9] is about a different person named Olov Blomkvist and is not relevant to our question.

Passage [1] mentions that the Mercurial Vapor is endorsed by many players, but it does not specify the national team of any of these players. Passage [3] does not mention the Mercurial Vapor at all. Therefore, we can eliminate passages [3] and [1] from our consideration. We are left with passages [2] and [5], which do not mention the Mercurial Vapor. However, passage [2] mentions a Brazilian football player who played for the Brazil national team, which is relevant to our question. Passage [5] does not mention the national team of any footballer.

We are trying to answer the question about the national team of a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for the Mercurial Vapor. We can start by looking at the passages that mention the Mercurial Vapor, which are passages [1] and [3]. Passage [1] mentions that the Mercurial Vapor is endorsed by many players, but it does not specify the national team of any of these players. Passage [3] does not mention the Mercurial Vapor at all. Therefore, we can eliminate passages [3] and [1] from our consideration. We are left with passages [2] and [5], which do not mention the Mercurial Vapor. However, passage [2] mentions a Brazilian football player who played for the Brazil national team, which is relevant to our question. Passage [5] does not mention the national team of any footballer. Therefore, we can conclude that passage [2] is the most helpful passage in answering our question, and passage [5] is the least helpful. The ranking is therefore [2], [5].\n",
