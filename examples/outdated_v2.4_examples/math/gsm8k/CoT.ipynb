We know that he has to let the bread rise for 120 minutes twice, which is 240 minutes. He also needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it and 30 minutes baking it.

How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with?\n",

Then, we subtract the amount he spent on goods from his supplier, which is $600. Next, we add the amount he received from his debtor, which is $800. Finally, we subtract the amount he spent on equipment maintenance, which is $1200. We can represent this as $2000 - $600 + $800 - $1200 = $1000.\n",

Each large box takes 4 feet of packing tape to seal, each medium box takes 2 feet of packing tape to seal, and each small box takes 1 foot of packing tape to seal. Each box also takes 1 foot of packing tape to stick the address label on. Debbie packed two large boxes, eight medium boxes, and five small boxes this afternoon. How much tape did she use?\n",
            "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the total amount of tape Debbie used. We know that she used 4 feet of tape for each large box, 2 feet of tape for each medium box, and 1 foot of tape for each small box. Therefore, we can calculate the total amount of tape used for each type of box by multiplying the number of boxes by the amount of tape needed for each box. For the large boxes, she used 4 feet of tape for each of the 2 boxes, so she used 8 feet of tape. For the medium boxes, she used 2 feet of tape for each of the 8 boxes, so she used 16 feet of tape. For the small boxes, she used 1 foot of tape for each of the 5 boxes, so she used 5 feet of tape. In total, she used 8 + 16 + 5 = 29 feet of tape. Additionally, she used 1 foot of tape for each box to stick the address label, so she used 15 feet of tape for the 15 boxes. Therefore, the total amount of tape she used is 29 + 15 = 44 feet.\n",

            "Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find the number of dogs Heloise remains with. We know that the total number of pets is 189, and the ratio of dogs to cats is 10:17. This means that for every 10 dogs, there are 17 cats. If we divide 189 by 27 (10+17), we get 7. This means that for every 7 sets of 10 dogs and 17 cats, there are 189 pets. Since we are only interested in the number of dogs, we can multiply 7 by 10 to get 70 dogs. If Heloise gives 10 dogs to Janet, she will remain with 70-10 = 60 dogs.\n",
