Thoughts and Planned Improvements for dspy.ReAct.

TOPIC 01: How Trajectories are Formatted, or rather when they are formatted.

Right now, both sub-modules are invoked with a `trajectory` argument, which is a string formatted in `forward`. Though
the formatter uses a general adapter.format_fields, the tracing of DSPy only sees the string, not the formatting logic.

What this means is that, in demonstrations, even if the user adjusts the adapter for a fixed program, the demos' format
will not update accordingly, but the inference-time trajectories will.

One way to fix this is to support `format=fn` in the dspy.InputField() for "trajectory" in the signatures. But this
means that care must be taken that the adapter is accessed at `forward` runtime, not signature definition time.

Another potential fix is to more natively support a "variadic" input field, where the input is a list of dictionaries,
or a big dictionary, and have each adatper format it accordingly.

Trajectories also affect meta-programming modules that view the trace later. It's inefficient O(n^2) to view the
trace of every module repeating the prefix.


TOPIC 02: Handling default arguments in the Tool class.


TOPIC 03: Simplifying ReAct's __init__ by moving modular logic to the Tool class.
    * Handling descriptions and casting.
    * Handling exceptions and error messages.
    * More cleanly defining the "finish" tool, perhaps as a runtime-defined function?


TOPIC 04: Default behavior when the trajectory gets too long.


TOPIC 05: Adding more structure around how the instruction is formatted.
    * Concretely, it's now a string, so an optimizer can and does rewrite it freely.
    * An alternative would be to add more structure, such that a certain template is fixed but values are variable?


TOPIC 06: Idiomatically allowing tools that maintain state across iterations, but not across different `forward` calls.
    * So the tool would be newly initialized at the start of each `forward` call, but maintain state across iterations.
    * This is pretty useful for allowing the agent to keep notes or count certain things, etc.

TOPIC 07: Make max_iters a bit more expressive.
    * Allow passing `max_iters` in forward to overwrite the default.
    * Get rid of `last_iteration: bool` in the format function. It's not necessary now.
