class WeaviateRM(dspy.Retrieve):
    """
    A retrieval module that uses Weaviate to return the top passages for a given query.

    Assumes that a Weaviate collection has been created and populated with the following payload:
        - content: The text of the passage

    Args:
        weaviate_collection_name (str): The name of the Weaviate collection.
        weaviate_client (WeaviateClient): An instance of the Weaviate client.
        k (int, optional): The default number of top passages to retrieve. Defaults to 3.

    Examples:
        Below is a code snippet that shows how to use Weaviate as the default retriver:
        ```python
        import weaviate

        llm = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
        weaviate_client = weaviate.Client("your-path-here")
        retriever_model = WeaviateRM(weaviate_collection_name="my_collection_name",
                                     weaviate_collection_text_key="content", 
                                     weaviate_client=weaviate_client)
        dspy.settings.configure(lm=llm, rm=retriever_model)
        ```

        Below is a code snippet that shows how to use Weaviate in the forward() function of a module
        ```python
        self.retrieve = WeaviateRM("my_collection_name", weaviate_client=weaviate_client, k=num_passages)
