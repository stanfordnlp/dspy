class BaseCallback:
    """A base class for defining callback handlers for DSPy components.

    To use a callback, subclass this class and implement the desired handlers. Each handler
    will be called at the appropriate time before/after the execution of the corresponding component.  For example, if
    you want to print a message before and after an LM is called, implement `the on_llm_start` and `on_lm_end` handler.
    Users can set the callback globally using `dspy.settings.configure` or locally by passing it to the component
    constructor.


    Example 1: Set a global callback using `dspy.settings.configure`.

    ```
    import dspy
    from dspy.utils.callback import BaseCallback

    class LoggingCallback(BaseCallback):

        def on_lm_start(self, call_id, instance, inputs):
            print(f"LM is called with inputs: {inputs}")

        def on_lm_end(self, call_id, outputs, exception):
            print(f"LM is finished with outputs: {outputs}")

    dspy.settings.configure(
        callbacks=[LoggingCallback()]
    )

    cot = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
    cot(question="What is the meaning of life?")

    # > LM is called with inputs: {'question': 'What is the meaning of life?'}
    # > LM is finished with outputs: {'answer': '42'}
    ```

    Example 2: Set a local callback by passing it to the component constructor.

    ```
    lm_1 = dspy.LM("gpt-3.5-turbo", callbacks=[LoggingCallback()])
    lm_1(question="What is the meaning of life?")

    # > LM is called with inputs: {'question': 'What is the meaning of life?'}
    # > LM is finished with outputs: {'answer': '42'}

    lm_2 = dspy.LM("gpt-3.5-turbo")
    lm_2(question="What is the meaning of life?")
    # No logging here because only `lm_1` has the callback set.
    ```
