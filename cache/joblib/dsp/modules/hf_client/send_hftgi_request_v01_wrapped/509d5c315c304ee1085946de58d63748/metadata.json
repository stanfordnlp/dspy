In 1929 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Novel/Literature, for her novel \"Scarlet Sister Mary.\" She wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Low Country. She was one of the few white authors who wrote about the African-American experience.\u00bb\\n[2] \u00abJulia Polak | Dr Dame Julia Margaret Polak, DBE, FMedSci (26 June 1939 \u2013 11 August 2014) was an Argentine-born British pathologist. She was head of the Centre for Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine at Imperial College London, a centre for medical research she set up with Larry Hench, also from Imperial College, to develop cells and tissues for transplantation into humans.\u00bb\\n[3] \u00abJulia Catherine Stimson | Julia Catherine Stimson {\\'1\\': \", \\'2\\': \", \\'3\\': \", \\'4\\': \"} (May 26, 1881 \u2013 September 30, 1948) was an American nurse, credited as one of several persons who brought nursing to the status of a profession.\u00bb\\n\\nQuestion: Who has a broader scope of profession: E. L. Doctorow or Julia Peterkin?\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the search query. We know that E. L. Doctorow is an author, and Julia Peterkin is an author as well. However, Julia Peterkin\\'s scope of profession is more broad than E. L. Doctorow\\'s, as she wrote about the plantation South, the Gullah people, and the African-American experience, while E. L. Doctorow\\'s works are more focused on the American experience. Therefore, the search query should be something like \"Julia Peterkin Pulitzer Prize\" or \"Julia Peterkin African-American experience.\"\\n\\nSearch Query:', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 75, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ['\\n', '\\n\\n']}}}"}, "time": 1697827642.1725242}
