In 1929 she won the Pulitzer Prize for Novel/Literature, for her novel \"Scarlet Sister Mary.\" She wrote several novels about the plantation South, especially the Gullah people of the Low Country.

It won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1929. The book was called obscene and banned at the public library in Gaffney, South Carolina. \"The Gaffney Ledger\" newspaper, however, serially published the complete book. Dr. Richard S. Burton, the chairperson of Pulitzer\\'s fiction-literature jury, recommended that the first prize go to the novel \"Victim and Victor\" by John Rathbone Oliver. His nomination was superseded by the School of Journalism\\'s choice of Peterkin\\'s book. Evidently in protest, Burton resigned from the jury.\u00bb\\n[5] \u00abJohn Rathbone Oliver | John Rathbone Oliver (January 4, 1872 \u2013 January 21, 1943) was an American psychiatrist, medical historian, author, and priest.
