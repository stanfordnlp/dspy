We know that the album was released in 2017 and that the song was originally released in 1992. Therefore, the producer of the album must have been someone who was active in the music industry in the 1990s and 2000s. One possible candidate is Rick Rubin, who has produced albums for many famous artists, including the Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Johnny Cash.
