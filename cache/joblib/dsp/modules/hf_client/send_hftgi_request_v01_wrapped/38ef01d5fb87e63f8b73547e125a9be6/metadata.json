The bulk of the tapes are not yet digitized, but the archive plans to digitize and distribute as many as possible online.

Set in the early 1960s among the Irish Catholic community in a small Yorkshire town, the book is about a 30-year-old mummy\\'s boy and his attempts at liberating himself from his domineering mother. The title refers to the latter\\'s wish that her \"favourite\" son, although already rather old for following his alleged vocation, become a clergyman. It was said that it was John Braine\\'s personal favourite novel of all those that he wrote and was finally filmed in 2005.\u00bb\\n[6] \u00abRoom at the Top (novel) | Room at the Top is a novel by John Braine, first published in the United Kingdom by Eyre & Spottiswoode in 1957, about the rise of an ambitious young man of humble origin, and the socio-economic struggles undergone in realising his social ambitions in post-war Britain.
