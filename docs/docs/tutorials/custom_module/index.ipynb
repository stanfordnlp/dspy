        "A [DSPy module](https://dspy.ai/learn/programming/modules/) is the building block for DSPy programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each built-in module abstracts a prompting technique (like chain of thought or ReAct). Crucially, they are generalized to handle any signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A DSPy module has learnable parameters (i.e., the little pieces comprising the prompt and the LM weights) and can be invoked (called) to process inputs and return outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multiple modules can be composed into bigger modules (programs). DSPy modules are inspired directly by NN modules in PyTorch, but applied to LM programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although you can build a DSPy program without implementing a custom module, we highly recommend putting your logic with a custom module so that you can use other DSPy features, like DSPy optimizer or MLflow DSPy tracing."
