# Extracting Information from Emails with DSPy

This tutorial demonstrates how to build an intelligent email processing system using DSPy. We'll create a system that can automatically extract key information from various types of emails, classify their intent, and structure the data for further processing.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a DSPy-powered email processing system that can:

- **Classify email types** (order confirmation, support request, meeting invitation, etc.)
- **Extract key entities** (dates, amounts, product names, contact info)
- **Determine urgency levels** and required actions
- **Structure extracted data** into consistent formats
- **Handle multiple email formats** robustly

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of DSPy modules and signatures
- Python 3.9+ installed
- OpenAI API key (or access to another supported LLM)

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install dspy
```

## Step 1: Define Our Data Structures

First, let's define the types of information we want to extract from emails:

```python
import dspy
from typing import List, Optional, Literal
from datetime import datetime
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum

class EmailType(str, Enum):
    ORDER_CONFIRMATION = "order_confirmation"
    SUPPORT_REQUEST = "support_request"
    MEETING_INVITATION = "meeting_invitation"
    NEWSLETTER = "newsletter"
    PROMOTIONAL = "promotional"
    INVOICE = "invoice"
    SHIPPING_NOTIFICATION = "shipping_notification"
    OTHER = "other"

class UrgencyLevel(str, Enum):
    LOW = "low"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    HIGH = "high"
    CRITICAL = "critical"

class ExtractedEntity(BaseModel):
    entity_type: str
    value: str
    confidence: float

class EmailInsight(BaseModel):
    email_type: EmailType
    urgency: UrgencyLevel
    summary: str
    key_entities: list[ExtractedEntity]
    action_required: bool
    deadline: Optional[str] = None
    amount: Optional[float] = None
    sender_info: Optional[str] = None
```

## Step 2: Create DSPy Signatures

Now let's define the signatures for our email processing pipeline:

```python
class ClassifyEmail(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify the type and urgency of an email based on its content."""

    email_subject: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The subject line of the email")
    email_body: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The main content of the email")
    sender: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Email sender information")

    email_type: EmailType = dspy.OutputField(desc="The classified type of email")
    urgency: UrgencyLevel = dspy.OutputField(desc="The urgency level of the email")
    reasoning: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="Brief explanation of the classification")

class ExtractEntities(dspy.Signature):
    """Extract key entities and information from email content."""

    email_content: str = dspy.InputField(desc="The full email content including subject and body")
    email_type: EmailType = dspy.InputField(desc="The classified type of email")

    key_entities: list[ExtractedEntity] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of extracted entities with type, value, and confidence")
    financial_amount: Optional[float] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Any monetary amounts found (e.g., '$99.99')")
    important_dates: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of important dates found in the email")
    contact_info: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Relevant contact information extracted")

class GenerateActionItems(dspy.Signature):
    """Determine what actions are needed based on the email content and extracted information."""

    email_type: EmailType = dspy.InputField()
    urgency: UrgencyLevel = dspy.InputField()
    email_summary: str = dspy.InputField(desc="Brief summary of the email content")
    extracted_entities: list[ExtractedEntity] = dspy.InputField(desc="Key entities found in the email")

    action_required: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc="Whether any action is required")
    action_items: list[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of specific actions needed")
    deadline: Optional[str] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Deadline for action if applicable")
    priority_score: int = dspy.OutputField(desc="Priority score from 1-10")

class SummarizeEmail(dspy.Signature):
    """Create a concise summary of the email content."""

    email_subject: str = dspy.InputField()
    email_body: str = dspy.InputField()
    key_entities: list[ExtractedEntity] = dspy.InputField()

    summary: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="A 2-3 sentence summary of the email's main points")
```

## Step 3: Build the Email Processing Module

Now let's create our main email processing module:

```python
class EmailProcessor(dspy.Module):
    """A comprehensive email processing system using DSPy."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Initialize our processing components
        self.classifier = dspy.ChainOfThought(ClassifyEmail)
        self.entity_extractor = dspy.ChainOfThought(ExtractEntities)
        self.action_generator = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateActionItems)
        self.summarizer = dspy.ChainOfThought(SummarizeEmail)

    def forward(self, email_subject: str, email_body: str, sender: str = ""):
        """Process an email and extract structured information."""

        # Step 1: Classify the email
        classification = self.classifier(
            email_subject=email_subject,
            email_body=email_body,
            sender=sender
        )

        # Step 2: Extract entities
        full_content = f"Subject: {email_subject}\n\nFrom: {sender}\n\n{email_body}"
        entities = self.entity_extractor(
            email_content=full_content,
            email_type=classification.email_type
        )

        # Step 3: Generate summary
        summary = self.summarizer(
            email_subject=email_subject,
            email_body=email_body,
            key_entities=entities.key_entities
        )

        # Step 4: Determine actions
        actions = self.action_generator(
            email_type=classification.email_type,
            urgency=classification.urgency,
            email_summary=summary.summary,
            extracted_entities=entities.key_entities
        )

        # Step 5: Structure the results
        return dspy.Prediction(
            email_type=classification.email_type,
            urgency=classification.urgency,
            summary=summary.summary,
            key_entities=entities.key_entities,
            financial_amount=entities.financial_amount,
            important_dates=entities.important_dates,
            action_required=actions.action_required,
            action_items=actions.action_items,
            deadline=actions.deadline,
            priority_score=actions.priority_score,
            reasoning=classification.reasoning,
            contact_info=entities.contact_info
        )
```

## Step 4: Running the Email Processing System

Let's create a simple function to test our email processing system:

```python
import os
def run_email_processing_demo():
    """Demonstration of the email processing system."""
    
    # Configure DSPy
    lm = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-4o-mini')
    dspy.configure(lm=lm)
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR OPENAI KEY>"
    
    # Create our email processor
    processor = EmailProcessor()
    
    # Sample emails for testing
    sample_emails = [
        {
            "subject": "Order Confirmation #12345 - Your MacBook Pro is on the way!",
            "body": """Dear John Smith,

        },
        {
            "subject": "URGENT: Server Outage - Immediate Action Required",
            "body": """Hi DevOps Team,

## Next Steps

- **Add more email types** and refine classification (newsletter, promotional, etc.)
- **Add integration** with email providers (Gmail API, Outlook, IMAP)
- **Experiment with different LLMs** and optimization strategies
- **Add multilingual support** for international email processing
- **Optimization** for increasing the performance of your program
