GEPA can also leverage additional supervision provided in this manner. For example, during optimization, we can return the correct solution's to the problems the program failed to solve.\n",

      "\n",
      "1) Read the prompt carefully and determine exactly what to compute and how the answer must be reported.\n",
      "   - If the problem asks for r^2 = p/q with p, q relatively prime and asks for p+q, return the integer p+q.\n",
      "   - If it asks for a probability m/n in lowest terms and then m+n, return that integer.\n",
      "   - If it asks for a single count, return that integer.\n",
      "   - Always reduce fractions to lowest terms before extracting p+q or m+n.\n",
      "   - Provide the final answer exactly in the requested format (usually a single integer). Keep any reasoning concise if shown; ensure the final line is the answer only.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) General problem-solving practices:\n",
      "   - Translate given conditions into equations/constraints and identify what quantity should be maximized or minimized. Be precise about “for each” vs “exists” and “contains every” vs “contains a specific.”\n",
      "   - Use symmetry to reduce variables when optimizing (extrema for symmetric constraints often occur when two variables are equal).\n",
      "   - For boxes/spheres: for a rectangular box with edges x, y, z, the sphere that contains it must have radius at least half the space diagonal: r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)/2. Surface area SA = 2(xy + yz + zx). Volume V = xyz.\n",
      "     • If asked for the smallest sphere that can contain every box in a set defined by constraints, you must maximize the required radius over that feasible set (worst case), not minimize it.\n",
      "     • With fixed S2 = xy + yz + zx and S3 = xyz, note x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 − 2S2, so maximizing the diagonal corresponds to maximizing S1 = x + y + z. At extrema under symmetric constraints, set two variables equal (e.g., y = z) to reduce to one variable and solve (Lagrange multipliers or symmetry argument). Use Rational Root Theorem when a cubic arises. Select the root that actually maximizes the target.\n",
      "   - For parity-based arrangement problems with pairs of identical items:\n",
      "     • “Even number of items between identical colors” means the two copies occupy positions of opposite parity (one odd, one even).\n",
      "     • If there are k colors with two copies each and positions 1..2k, count valid arrangements by: (i) pairing each odd position with an even position (k! ways), and (ii) assigning colors to the k pairs (k! ways). Total valid = (k!)^2. Total permutations with duplicates = (2k)! / (2!)^k. Simplify the resulting probability fully before computing m+n.\n",
      "   - For grid/monochromatic row-column constraints with maximality:\n",
      "     • “All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color” implies the grid is determined by sets of white rows W_r and white columns W_c: all cells in W_r × W_c are white; all cells in the complementary set of rows and columns B_r × B_c are black; the cross rectangles W_r × B_c and B_r × W_c must be empty to keep row/column uniformity.\n",
      "     • “Any additional chip would violate” (maximality) rules out having both some empty rows and some empty columns simultaneously where their intersection would admit a valid placement. A clean equivalent counting for a 5×5 grid is:\n",
      "       - Choose rows and columns occupied by white chips as any nonempty, not-all subsets: (2^5 − 2) choices for rows and (2^5 − 2) for columns. This yields (2^5 − 2)^2 configurations with both colors present.\n",
      "       - Add 2 for the all-white and all-black full boards. The empty board is disallowed by “some chips.”\n",
      "       - For 5×5, the total is (32 − 2)^2 + 2 = 900 + 2 = 902.\n",
      "     • Chips are indistinguishable; once W_r and W_c are fixed, the configuration is uniquely determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Algebraic care and verification:\n",
      "   - Keep track of whether you are maximizing or minimizing; re-check interpretations like “smallest sphere that can contain each box” (maximize over the set) vs “for a given box” (minimize for that box).\n",
      "   - When radicals appear but the problem expects a rational r^2, express r^2 directly from symmetric sums if possible to avoid unnecessary radicals.\n",
      "   - Rationalize and reduce fractions; ensure p and q are coprime before summing.\n",
      "   - Sanity-check candidate extrema numerically to ensure you selected the correct root (e.g., larger S1 for maximizing diagonal).\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Output formatting:\n",
