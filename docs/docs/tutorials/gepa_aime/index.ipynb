    "\n",
    "GEPA is a _reflective_ prompt optimizer, and it's strength lies in being able to leverage additional sources of information, like the DSPy program's execution and evaluation pipelines, which provides GEPA more visibility into why the system got the score that it did, and then GEPA can introspect to identify how to improve the score. GEPA can also leverage additional supervision provided in this manner. For example, during optimization, we can return the correct solution's to the problems the program failed to solve.\n",

    "We note that while such explicit supervision is not available in all scenarios, GEPA can work very flexibly with different forms of feedback (for example, using LLM-as-a-judge feedback shown in the PAPILLON tutorial, or just using answer labels, as shown in the facility-support tutorial).\n",

      "- Enforce digit ranges strictly (e.g., in base 9, digits ∈ {0,…,8}; if also a is a base-10 leading digit, then a ∈ {1,…,8}).\n",

      "  • 3-digit octal: (A B A)_8 = 65A + 8B.\n",

      "- Complement pairs: S and S^c cannot both be present. Use this to structure counts.\n",
      "- Use size-based pigeonhole facts: In [n], any two subsets of size > n/2 must intersect. For n = 5, any two subsets of size ≥ 3 intersect; thus “all subsets of size ≥ 3” is an intersecting family (size 16).\n",
      "- Do not assume that “stars” (all subsets containing a fixed element) are the only intersecting families of maximum size. For odd n, both the star and “all subsets of size > n/2” have size 2^{n−1}.\n",
      "- When counting collections of a fixed size:\n",
      "  • Consider the minimum set size N in the family and do casework on how many 2-element sets are included (for n=5), as these control which 3-sets must be excluded (complements).\n",
