        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we will walk you through how to build an AI agents with DSPy. AI agents refer to the system that can autonomously perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike a single model prompt, an agent typically follows a loop of reasoning, planning, and acting, often integrating tools like search engines, APIs, or memory to complete complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial focuses on a popular architecture of AI agents called ReAct, standing for **Re**asoning and **Act**ing, which provides a task description along with a list of tools to LM, then lets LM decide whether to call tools for more obseravations, or generate the final output.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Book new trips on behalf of the user.\n",
        "- Modify existing trips, including flight change and cancellation.\n",
