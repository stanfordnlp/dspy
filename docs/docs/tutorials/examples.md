# Community Examples

The DSPy team believes complexity has to be justified. We take this seriously: we never release a complex tutorial (above) or example (below) _unless we can demonstrate empirically that this complexity has generally led to improved quality or cost._ This kind of rule is rarely enforced by other frameworks or docs, but you can count on it in DSPy examples.

There's a bunch of examples in the `examples/` directory and in the top-level directory. We welcome contributions!

You can find other examples tweeted by [@lateinteraction](https://twitter.com/lateinteraction) on Twitter/X.
