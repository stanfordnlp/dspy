    "# Tutorial: Building Multi-Agent Systems with Cultural Personalities\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates how to build a production-ready multi-agent system where each agent has a distinct cultural personality using DSPy. We'll create agents inspired by Brazilian historical figures, each with unique communication styles, expertise areas, and specialized capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is based on [Cidadao.AI](https://github.com/anderson-ufrj/cidadao.ai-backend), a government transparency platform that uses **22 AI agents** with Brazilian cultural identities to analyze public data and fight corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**See the full system in action:** [Cidadao.AI Live Demo](https://cidadao-ai-frontend.vercel.app/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Architecture**: Design patterns for multi-agent systems with distinct personalities\n",
    "2. **DSPy Signatures**: Structured input/output interfaces for agent communication\n",
    "3. **Custom Modules**: Building `dspy.Module` with `ChainOfThought` for natural responses\n",
    "4. **Intent Routing**: Automatically directing queries to the most appropriate agent\n",
    "5. **Agent Collaboration**: Chaining multiple agents for complex investigations\n",
    "6. **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response generation for better UX\n",
    "7. **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when LLM is unavailable\n",
    "8. **Optimization**: Using DSPy optimizers to improve agent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -U dspy\n",
