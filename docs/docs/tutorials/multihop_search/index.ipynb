We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. `GPT-4o`, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much."
