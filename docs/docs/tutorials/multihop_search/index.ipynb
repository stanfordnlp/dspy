    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> is an LLMOps tool that natively integrates with DSPy and offer explainability and experiment tracking. In this tutorial, you can use MLflow to visualize prompts and optimization progress as traces to understand the DSPy's behavior better. You can set up MLflow easily by following the four steps below.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "mlflow ui --port 5000\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Connect the notebook to MLflow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mlflow\n",

    "mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\n",

We'll also set up a larger LM, i.e. `GPT-4o`, as a teacher that we'll invoke a very small number of times to help teach the small LM. This is technically not necessary; the small model can typically teach itself tasks like this in DSPy. But using a larger teacher will give us some peace of mind, where the initial system or optimizer configuration doesn't matter as much."
