    "Let's walk through a quick example of setting up a `dspy.ReAct` agent with a couple of tools and optimizing it to conduct advanced browsing for multi-hop search.\n",

    "### MLflow DSPy Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> is an LLMOps tool that natively integrates with DSPy and offer explainability and experiment tracking. In this tutorial, you can use MLflow to visualize prompts and optimization progress as traces to understand the DSPy's behavior better. You can set up MLflow easily by following the four steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MLflow Trace](./mlflow-tracing-agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install MLflow\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "%pip install mlflow>=2.20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Start MLflow UI in a separate terminal\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mlflow ui --port 5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Connect the notebook to MLflow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "\n",
    "mlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\n",
    "mlflow.set_experiment(\"DSPy\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Enabling tracing.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mlflow.dspy.autolog()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the steps above, you can see traces for each program execution on the notebook. They provide great visibility into the model's behavior and helps you understand the DSPy's concepts better throughout the tutorial.\n",
