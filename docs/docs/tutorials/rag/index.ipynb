      "[1] «As far as I remember, High Memory is used for application space and Low Memory for the kernel. Advantage is that (user-space) applications cant access kernel-space memory.»\n",
      "[2] «For the people looking for an explanation in the context of Linux kernel memory space, beware that there are two conflicting definitions of the high/low memory split (unfortunately there is no standard, one has to interpret that in context): High memory defined as the totality of kernel space in VIRTUAL memory. This is a region that only the kernel can access and comprises all virtual addresses greater or equal than PAGE_OFFSET. Low memory refers therefore to the region of the remaining addresses, which correspond to the user-space memory accessible from each user process. For example: on 32-bit x86 with a default PAGE_OFFSET, this means that high memory is any address ADDR with ADDR ≥ 0xC0000000 = PAGE_OFFSET (i.e. higher 1 GB). This is the reason why in Linux 32-bit processes are typically limited to 3 GB. Note that PAGE_OFFSET cannot be configured directly, it depends on the configurable VMSPLIT_x options (source). To summarize: in 32-bit archs, virtual memory is by default split into lower 3 GB (user space) and higher 1 GB (kernel space). For 64 bit, PAGE_OFFSET is not configurable and depends on architectural details that are sometimes detected at runtime during kernel load. On x86_64, PAGE_OFFSET is 0xffff888000000000 for 4-level paging (typical) and 0xff11000000000000 for 5-level paging (source). For ARM64 this is usually 0x8000000000000000. Note though, if KASLR is enabled, this value is intentionally unpredictable. High memory defined as the portion of PHYSICAL memory that cannot be mapped contiguously with the rest of the kernel virtual memory. A portion of the kernel virtual address space can be mapped as a single contiguous chunk into the so-called physical low memory. To fully understand what this means, a deeper knowledge of the Linux virtual memory space is required. I would recommend going through these slides. From the slides: This kind of high/low memory split is only applicable to 32-bit architectures where the installed physical RAM size is relatively high (more than ~1 GB). Otherwise, i.e. when the physical address space is small (<1 GB) or when the virtual memory space is large (64 bits), the whole physical space can be accessed from the kernel virtual memory space. In that case, all physical memory is considered low memory. It is preferable that high memory does not exist at all because the whole physical space can be accessed directly from the kernel, which makes memory management a lot simpler and efficient. This is especially important when dealing with DMAs (which typically require physically contiguous memory). See also the answer by @gilles»\n",
      "[3] «Low and High do not refer to whether there is a lot of usage or not. They represent the way it is organized by the system. According to Wikipedia: High Memory is the part of physical memory in a computer which is not directly mapped by the page tables of its operating system kernel. There is no duration for the free command which simply computes a snapshot of the information available. Most people, including programmers, do not need to understand it more clearly as it is managed in a much simpler form through system calls and compiler/interpreter operations.»\n",
      "[4] «This is relevant to the Linux kernel; Im not sure how any Unix kernel handles this. The High Memory is the segment of memory that user-space programs can address. It cannot touch Low Memory. Low Memory is the segment of memory that the Linux kernel can address directly. If the kernel must access High Memory, it has to map it into its own address space first. There was a patch introduced recently that lets you control where the segment is. The tradeoff is that you can take addressable memory away from user space so that the kernel can have more memory that it does not have to map before using. Additional resources: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/KernelAnalysis-HOWTO-7.html http://linux-mm.org/HighMemory»\n",
      "[5] «HIGHMEM is a range of kernels memory space, but it is NOT memory you access but its a place where you put what you want to access. A typical 32bit Linux virtual memory map is like: 0x00000000-0xbfffffff: user process (3GB) 0xc0000000-0xffffffff: kernel space (1GB) (CPU-specific vector and whatsoever are ignored here). Linux splits the 1GB kernel space into 2 pieces, LOWMEM and HIGHMEM. The split varies from installation to installation. If an installation chooses, say, 512MB-512MB for LOW and HIGH mems, the 512MB LOWMEM (0xc0000000-0xdfffffff) is statically mapped at the kernel boot time; usually the first so many bytes of the physical memory is used for this so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have a constant offset of, say, 0xc0000000. On the other hand, the latter 512MB (HIGHMEM) has no static mapping (although you could leave pages semi-permanently mapped there, but you must do so explicitly in your driver code). Instead, pages are temporarily mapped and unmapped here so that virtual and physical addresses in this range have no consistent mapping. Typical uses of HIGHMEM include single-time data buffers.»\n",

    "1. Explore better system architectures for your program, e.g. what if we ask the LM to generate search queries for the retriever? See this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/intro.ipynb) or the [STORM pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) built in DSPy.\n",
    "2. Explore different [prompt optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695) or [weight optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930). See the **[Optimizers Docs](/building-blocks/6-optimizers)**.\n",
    "3. Scale inference time compute using DSPy Optimizers, e.g. this [notebook](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/agents/multi_agent.ipynb).\n",
    "4. Cut cost by distilling to a smaller LM, via prompt or weight optimization, e.g. [this notebook](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/nli/scone/scone.ipynb) or [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/qa/hotpot/multihop_finetune.ipynb).\n",

    "How do you decide which ones to proceed with first?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to look at your system outputs, which will allow you to identify the sources of lower performance if any. While doing all of this, make sure you continue to refine your metric, e.g. by optimizing against your judgments, and to collect more (or more realistic) data, e.g. from related domains or from putting a demo of your system in front of users.\n",
