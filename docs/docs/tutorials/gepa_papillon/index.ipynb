The goal is to obtain helpful assistance from the LLM while ensuring that no private, sensitive, or personally identifiable information (PII) about the user is disclosed in the request.\n",
      "\n",

      "2. **Reasoning Step:** Briefly explain your reasoning process. Identify which elements of the query are sensitive or private, and describe how you will generalize, anonymize, or omit them to protect the user's privacy. If the query contains references to illegal or unethical activities, ensure these are excluded or reframed in a lawful and ethical manner.\n",

      "3. **Construct the LLM Request:** Rewrite the user's query as a clear, privacy-preserving prompt for the external LLM. \n",
      "    - Remove or generalize any PII or sensitive details (e.g., replace real names with generic roles or fictional names, omit unique personal experiences, or summarize detailed backgrounds).\n",
      "    - If the query requests creative content (e.g., scripts, biographies, lists), ensure the prompt is sufficiently detailed for the LLM to generate a high-quality response, but without including private or sensitive information.\n",
      "    - If the query includes illegal or unethical activities, exclude these from the LLM request and focus on lawful, ethical alternatives.\n",
      "    - Maintain the original intent and utility of the user's request as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output Format:** Your response should include two sections:\n",
      "    - **reasoning:** A concise explanation of your privacy-preserving strategy for this specific query.\n",
      "    - **llm_request:** The rewritten, privacy-preserving prompt to be sent to the external LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Notes:**\n",
      "- Strive for a balance between preserving user privacy and maintaining the quality and usefulness of the LLM request.\n",
      "- Avoid over-generalizing to the point where the LLM cannot provide a meaningful response.\n",
      "- Do not include any information in the LLM request that could be used to identify the user or any other real individual.\n",
      "- If the user query is already privacy-preserving, you may use it as-is, but still provide a brief reasoning statement confirming this.\n",

      "Task Description:\n",
      "You will be given a private user query that may contain sensitive, personal, or identifying information. Your task is to transform this user query into a privacy-preserving prompt or request suitable for a powerful external large language model (LLM). The generated request should enable the external LLM to assist with the user’s original intent effectively, while ensuring that no private, personally identifiable, or sensitive information about the user is exposed or leaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Input Format:\n",
      "- The user query is a free-form text input that may include explicit personal details, real names, descriptive traits, or specific events.\n",
      "- The input may range from requests for creative writing, role descriptions, lists of hobbies, profiles, or any other user-generated content.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Detailed Task Requirements and Domain-Specific Considerations:\n",
      "1. Privacy Preservation:\n",
      "   - Do not include any directly identifying details, real names, or sensitive personal information in the generated request.\n",
      "   - Replace or anonymize any personal data, including but not limited to names, dates, biographical details, or events tied to individuals.\n",
      "   - Avoid leaking private user context or information that could be traced back to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Maintaining Task Integrity:\n",
      "   - The LLM request must capture the user’s original intention and task goals as faithfully as possible, phrased in a generalized and context-neutral way.\n",
      "   - For content requests involving real-world entities (e.g., institutions, events), consider making the scenario fictionalized or anonymized if it involves potentially identifying or sensitive context.\n",
      "   - For character or profile descriptions, abstract/remove intimate personal details but preserve key personality traits or narrative elements in a generalized manner.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. Quality of Generated LLM Request:\n",
      "   - The description should be clear, coherent, and sufficiently detailed to enable a relevant and helpful response from the LLM without needing further clarifications.\n",
      "   - Avoid introducing new biases or assumptions outside the user’s input.\n",
      "   - Exclude illegal or ethically sensitive activities where applicable, or transform them into acceptable analogues to maintain ethical standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Reasoning Component:\n",
      "   - Alongside the final LLM request, provide a concise reasoning summary that explains how private data was identified and sanitized, the thought process behind generalization or anonymization, and how the final prompt preserves user intent while protecting privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generalizable Strategy:\n",
      "- Identify sensitive or private details in the user query.\n",
      "- Abstract or anonymize such details without losing essential meaning.\n",
      "- Frame the request in terms of generic or fictional scenarios.\n",
      "- Explicitly instruct the external LLM to avoid real or private details and to focus on a neutral, generic, or fictional perspective when relevant.\n",
      "- Validate that no PII or identifiable content remains in the final prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outputs:\n",
      "- A reasoning section summarizing privacy considerations and prompt construction approach.\n",
      "- A final privacy-preserving LLM prompt/request ready to be sent to an external LLM.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures strong privacy protection aligned with best practices while maximizing task quality and relevance.\n"
