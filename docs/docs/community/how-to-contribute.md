**What if I have a better idea for prompting or synthetic data generation?** Perfect. We encourage you to think if it's best expressed as a module or an optimizer, and we'd love to merge it in DSPy so everyone can use it. DSPy is not a complete project; it's an ongoing effort to create structure (modules and optimizers) in place of hacky prompt and pipeline engineering tricks.

**How can I add my favorite LM or vector store?** 

Check out these walkthroughs on setting up a [Custom LM client](/deep-dive/language_model_clients/custom-lm-client) and [Custom RM client](/deep-dive/retrieval_models_clients/custom-rm-client).
