DSPy: *Programming*—not prompting—Foundation Models
----------------------------------------------------

(links to paper and iamges from readme)

**DSPy** is the framework for solving advanced tasks with language models (LMs) and retrieval models (RMs). **DSPy** unifies techniques for **prompting** and **fine-tuning** LMs — and approaches for **reasoning**, **self-improvement**, and **augmentation with retrieval and tools**.
